I'm Gabriel, 28 years old, a Chemistry Student and also studying Web Development and looking to grow up, 
learn and develop myself in a tech area. I have experience in chemistry labs, working with planning and synthesis of anti-HIV drugs. ðŸ˜Š

About me, I'm a cat's father, and her name is Ariel. It's so cute, but it's a little wild. 
In my free time, I love to watch anime and movies, like a movie buff. Furthermore, I love tattoos. ðŸŽ¥

I consider myself a dynamic, communicative and proactive, who loves to lead projects. 
I always like being connected to new trends, innovating soon as possible my skills, and keeping my focus on my priorities. 
I'm always studying a lot, trying to improve my tech skills, and I want a chance to get a job in a web development area. ðŸ¤“
